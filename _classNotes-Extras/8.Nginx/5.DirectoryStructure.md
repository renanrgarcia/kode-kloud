# Directory Structure

- **/etc/nginx/**: The main directory for Nginx configuration files.
  - **nginx.conf**: The primary configuration file for Nginx, where global settings and server blocks are defined.
- **/etc/nginx/sites-available/**: Contains configuration files for individual sites, virtual hosts, or applications. Each file typically represents a server block.
- **/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/**: Contains symbolic links to the configuration files in `sites-available` that are currently enabled. Nginx reads configurations from this directory when it starts.
- **/etc/nginx/conf.d/**: A directory for additional configuration files that are included in the main `nginx.conf`. This is often used for modular configurations or to include specific settings for different applications.
- **/var/www/**: The default document root directory where website files are stored. This can vary based on the distribution and configuration. Default on Debian/Ubuntu is `/var/www/html`. Different distributions may use different paths, such as `/usr/share/nginx/html` on CentOS/RHEL.
- **/etc/nginx/mime.types**: A file that maps file extensions to MIME types, allowing Nginx to serve files with the correct content type.
  - MIME types are used to tell the browser how to handle different file types, such as images, scripts, and stylesheets.
- **/etc/nginx/nginx.pid**: The file that contains the process ID (PID) of the Nginx master process. This is used for managing the Nginx service, such as stopping or restarting it.
- **/var/log/nginx/**: The directory where Nginx logs are stored.
  - **access.log**: Contains a record of all requests processed by Nginx, including client IP addresses, requested URLs, and response status codes.
  - **error.log**: Contains error messages and diagnostic information about issues encountered by Nginx while processing requests.
