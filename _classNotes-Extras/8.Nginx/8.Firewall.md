# Firewall

- Along with the installation of Nginx, it is important to configure the firewall to allow traffic on the HTTP and HTTPS ports. This ensures that web traffic can reach the Nginx server.

## UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) - Ubuntu/Debian

- UFW is a user-friendly interface for managing firewall rules on Ubuntu and Debian systems.

- Enabling and configuring UFW for Nginx:

```bash
sudo ufw enable # Enable UFW

sudo ufw allow port_[port_number]/tcp # Allow specific port for TCP traffic
sudo ufw reload # Reload UFW to apply changes

sudo ufw status numbered # Check the status of UFW with numbered rules
sudo ufw delete [rule_number] # Delete a specific rule by its number
sudo ufw reload # Reload UFW to apply changes
```

## Firewalld - CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora.

- Firewalld is a dynamic firewall management tool that provides a way to manage firewall rules without restarting the service.
- Enabling and configuring Firewalld for Nginx:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=[port_number]/tcp # Allow specific port for TCP traffic
sudo firewall-cmd --reload # Reload Firewalld to apply changes

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=[port_number]/tcp # Remove a specific port rule
sudo firewall-cmd --reload # Reload Firewalld to apply changes

sudo firewall-cmd --list-all # List all active rules and settings
```
