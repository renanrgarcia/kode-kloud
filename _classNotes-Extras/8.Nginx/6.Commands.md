# Commands

- `nginx -h`: Displays help information for Nginx commands.
- `nginx -v`: Shows the version of Nginx installed.
- `nginx -V`: Displays the version and configuration options of Nginx, including compiled-in modules.
- `nginx -t`: Tests the Nginx configuration for syntax errors without starting the server. This is useful for verifying configuration changes before applying them.
- `nginx -T`: Dumps the complete Nginx configuration to the console, including all included files. This is helpful for debugging and understanding the current configuration.
- `nginx -s`: Used to send signals to the Nginx master process for controlling its behavior.
  - `nginx -s stop`: Stops the Nginx server gracefully, allowing current connections to finish before shutting down.
  - `nginx -s quit`: Similar to `stop`, but it allows Nginx to finish processing requests and then exit.
  - `nginx -s reload`: Reloads the Nginx configuration without stopping the server. This is useful for applying configuration changes without downtime.
    - It's more efficient than stopping and starting Nginx, as it allows existing connections to continue while new connections use the updated configuration.
    - It's a good practice to run `nginx -t` before `nginx -s reload` to ensure there are no syntax errors in the configuration.
  - `nginx -s reopen`: Reopens the log files, which is useful for log rotation without restarting Nginx.
