# Prometheus Basics

- Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints.
- The scraped data is stored in a time-series database, which can be queried using PromQL.
- It can monitor only numeric data. It can't monitor logs, events, or traces.
- It's written in Go and are part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Architecture

- **Main components**:
  - **Retrieval**: Responsible for scraping metrics from monitored targets.
  - **TSDB**: Time-series database that stores the scraped data.
  - **HTTP Server**: Accepts PromQL queries and returns the results.
