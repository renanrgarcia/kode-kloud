# SLI

- Service Level Indicator (SLI) is a quantitative measure of the service level provided by a service.
- Exs:
  - Request latency, error rate, availability, throughput, saturation, etc.
- Not all metrics makes good SLIs. You want to find metrics that accurately represent the user experience.
  - Ex: Request latency is a good SLI, but CPU usage is not.

# SLO

- Service Level Object (SLO) is the target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI.
- Exs:
  - 99% of requests should be served in less than 100ms. (SLI: Request latency)
  - 99.9% of uptime. (SLI: Availability)
- The aim is not perfection, but to provide a good service level.

# SLA

- Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of service (SLO).
