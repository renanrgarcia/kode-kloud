# Observability

- Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.
  - It allows us to generate actionable outputs from unexpected scenarios in dynamic systems.
  - Benefits:
    - Better insight into internal workings.
    - Speed up troubleshoting.
    - Detect hard to catch problems.
    - Improve cross-team collaboration.
  - Main porpuse: to understand the system's behavior.
- The observability became even more important with the adoption of microservices.

## Pillars of Observability

1. **Logs**: Record of events that happened in the system. Comprised of: timestamp, log level, and message.
   - Logs are useful for debugging and troubleshooting.
   - They are a good source of information for the system's behavior.
   - They can be used to monitor the system's performance.
   - Ex: 08:00:00 INFO: User logged in.
2. **Metrics**: Quantitative data about the system's performance. Comprised of: metric name, value, timestamp, and dimensions.
   - Metrics are useful for monitoring the system's performance.
   - They can be used to detect performance issues.
   - They can be used to detect trends and patterns.
   - Ex: CPU usage: 80%.
3. **Traces**: Record of the path that a request takes through the system. Comprised of: trace ID, span ID, parent ID, and timestamp.
   - Span: A unit of work in the system.
   - Traces are useful for understanding the system's behavior.
   - They can be used to detect bottlenecks and performance issues.
   - They can be used to detect errors and exceptions.
   - Ex: Trace ID: 123, Span ID: 1, Parent ID: 0.

## And Prometheus?

- Focus on metrics!
