# Networking

- The VMs have up to 4 adapters.
- `Host-only adapter` is used for communication between VMs and the host. It is a private network.
  - Here, the VMs can communicate with each other and the host, but they cannot communicate with the external network.
  - But with ip forwarding, the VMs can communicate with the external network.
- `LAN: Local Area Network`. It is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.
- `NAT: Network Address Translation`. This adapter is used for communication between VMs and the internet. Now, the VMs can access the internet.
  - In this case, the host acts as a router. The host has a private IP address and a public IP address. The host uses the public IP address to communicate with the internet. The host uses the private IP address to communicate with the VMs. That's why the translation is needed.
- `NAT Network` is different from `NAT` because the VMs can communicate with each other, but they still need NAT to reach the external network.
  - In both NAT and NAT Network, the VMs have access to the internet as long as the host has access to the internet.
- `Bridged Adapter` is used to connect the VMs to the LAN. The VMs can communicate with the host and the external network. The VMs have their own IP addresses.
  - On bridged adapter, the VMs can reach the internet as well as the host.

## Port Forwarding

- Port forwarding is used to forward the traffic from the host to the VM.
- For example, if the host has a web server running on port 80, and the VM has a web server running on port 80, then the host can forward the traffic from port 8080 to the VM's port 80.
  - Port 22 is used for SSH.
