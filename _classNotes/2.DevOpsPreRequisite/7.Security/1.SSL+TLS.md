## Types of encryption

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt data. It is faster than asymmetric encryption but less secure. Examples include DES, AES, and Blowfish.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) to encrypt and decrypt data. It is slower than symmetric encryption but more secure. Examples include RSA, DSA, and ECC.
  - **Public Key**: Used to encrypt data.
  - **Private Key**: Used to decrypt data.
- SSH uses asymmetric encryption.
  - For example: id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key).
- On client-server communication, we can use OpenSSL to generate the keys.
  - `openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024` to generate a private key.
  - The keys are stored in the `.pem` format: `private.pem` and `public.pem`.
  - The client receives the public key and the server keeps the private key.
  - The client encrypts the data using the public key and sends it to the server.
  - The server decrypts the data using the private key.
- There can be `.crt` or `.key` as well

# SSL and TLS Certificates

- A Certificate is a digital document that binds a public key to a person, computer, or organization. It is used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual or organization.
- It's important to see if the certificate is valid, not expired, and issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
  - Examples of CAs include VeriSign, Thawte, and GeoTrust.
- The browser checks the certificate and if it's valid, it shows a padlock icon in the address bar. The check is done using the CA's public key.
  - After this, the communication continues using symmetric encryption.
- About Client Certificate > PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is used to issue certificates. The client certificate is used to authenticate the client to the server.
  - The client sends the certificate to the server.
  - The server checks the certificate and if it's valid, it allows the client to access the server.
- SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols that provide security for communications over networks such as the Internet.
  - TLS (Transport Layer Security) is just an updated, more secure, version of SSL (Secure Socket Layer).
