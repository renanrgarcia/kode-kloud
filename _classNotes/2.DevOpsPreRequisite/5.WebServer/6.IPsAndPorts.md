# IPs and Ports

- `ip addr show` - To show the IP address of the system
  - enp0s3: Ethernet interface, IP address: 10.0.2.15
  - wlp2s0: Wireless interface, IP address: 10.0.2.16
  - lo: Loopback interface, IP address: 127.0.0.1 == localhost (Within the server)
- Each interface has logical division called ports, there can be 65535 ports
- For example, we can set a Flask App to listen:
  - `app.run(host='10.0.2.15', port=5000)`
- If we want to listen on all interfaces, we can use:
  - `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)`
- If we want to listen only on loopback interface, we can use:
  - `app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)`
