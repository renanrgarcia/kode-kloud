# Concepts

## Switching

- Switching is a process of forwarding data packets between devices in a network.
- `ip link`: To list all the network interfaces in a host machine.
  - Ex: eth0, eth1, lo, wlan0, etc.
- `ip addr`: To display the IP address of a network interface.
- `ip addr add ip_address/mask dev interface_name`: To assign an IP address to a network interface.
  - Ex: `ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0`
- `ping ip_address`: To check the connectivity between two hosts.
  - Ex: `ping 192.168.1.10`

## Routing

- Routing is a process of forwarding data packets between different networks.
- Gateway: A device that connects two different networks.
- `route` or `ip route`: To display the routing table.
- `ip route add network_address/mask via gateway_address`: To add a route to the routing table. It tells the host to send the packets to the gateway to reach the destination network.
- If you want to reach the internet, you need to add it to the routing table: `ip route add internet_address/mask via gateway_address`
- Default (0.0.0.0) Gateway: A gateway that is used when there is no specific route in the routing table.
- `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`: To check if the IP forwarding is enabled or not. IP forwarding means the host can forward the packets between different networks.
- `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`: To enable IP forwarding.
- `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`: To enable IP forwarding permanently.
