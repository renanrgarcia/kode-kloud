# DNS

- We use DNS to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- `cat >> /etc/hosts`: To add a domain name and its IP address to the hosts file.
  - Ex: 192.168.1.11 www.example.com
- `hostname`: To display the hostname of a host machine.
- Name resolution means converting a domain name to an IP address.
  - `curl www.example.com`: To check if the domain name is resolved to an IP address.

## DNS Server

- The DNS server is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
  - `cat /etc/resolv.conf`: To display the DNS server IP address.
- First, the host checks the hosts file for the domain name. If it is not found, it sends a request to the DNS server.
  - `cat /etc/nsswitch.conf`: To check the order of name resolution.

## Domain Name

- A domain name is a human-readable name that is used to access a website.
- .com, .org, .net, etc., are top-level domains.
- Subdomains are used to organize the domain names.
  - Ex: drive, www, mail, apps, etc.
- Ex: apps.google.com, mail.google.com, etc.

## Record Types

- **A Record**: To map a domain name to an IP address.
- **CNAME Record**: To map an alias name to a domain name.
  - Ex: www.example.com -> example.com

## Other tools

- `nslookup domain_name`: To check the IP address of a domain name.
- `dig domain_name`: To check the DNS records of a domain name.
