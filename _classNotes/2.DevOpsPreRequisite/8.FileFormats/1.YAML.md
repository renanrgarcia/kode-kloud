# Yaml

- **YAML** is a human-readable data serialization standard that can be used in conjunction with all programming languages and is often used to write configuration files.
- Lists/Arrays are represented by a hyphen and a space (`-`). They are ordered.
- Dictionary/Maps are indented and use a colon (`:`) to separate the key and value pairs. They are unordered.
- Comments are represented by a hash (`#`) symbol.
- Example of list of dictionaries a YAML file:

```yaml
- color: red
  model:
    name: Toyota Corolla
    year: 2020
  transmission: automatic
  price: 20000
- color: blue
  model:
    name: Honda Civic
    year: 2019
  transmission: manual
  price: 18000
- color: black
  model:
    name: Ford Mustang
