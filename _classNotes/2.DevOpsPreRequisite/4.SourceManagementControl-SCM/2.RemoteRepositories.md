# Remote repositories

- The changes on local repositories can be pushed to remote repositories.
- The changes on remote repositories can be pulled to local repositories.
- There can be conflicts while pushing and pulling the changes. The conflicts can be resolved by merging the changes.
- The remote repositories can be hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
- The remote repositories can be public or private.
- `git remote add <remoteName> <URL>`: Add a remote repository.
- `git remote add github`: Add a remote repository named `github`.
- `git push -u <remoteName> <branchName>`: Push changes to a remote repository.
  - `-u`: Set the upstream, meaning the next time you can just use `git push`.
- `git pull <remoteName> <branchName>`: Pull changes from a remote repository.
- `git remote -v`: List the remote repositories.
  - Example output:
    ```bash
    origin https: //github.com/username/repo.git(fetch)
    origin https: //github.com/username/repo.git(push)
    ```
