# Services

- Services are the programs that run in the background and are started at boot time.
- `service service-name start`: To start a service. Uses `systemctl` under the hood.
- `systemctl start service-name`: To start a service. Used to manage services.
- `systemctl stop service-name`: To stop a service.
- `systemctl status service-name`: To check the status of a service.
- `systemctl enable service-name`: To enable a service to start at boot time.
- `systemctl disable service-name`: To disable a service from starting at boot time.

## Example

- `/usr/bin/python3 /opt/code/app.py`: To start a Python application. In this case, a Flask application on port 5000.
- `curl localhost:5000`: To check if the application is running.
- To configure the application as a service:
- Create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/app.service`. This is the configuration file for the service.
- `/usr/lib/systemd/system/app.service`: The default location for the service files.

```bash
# Description of the service
[Unit]
Description=Flask Application

# Defines the service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/code/app.py
ExecStartPre=/opt/code/configure_db.sh
ExecStartPost=/opt/code/email_status.sh
Restart=always

# Configure to start after multi-user.target is started
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- `systemctl daemon-reload`: To reload the daemon. It makes the system aware of the new service file.
- `systemctl start app`: To start the service.
- `systemctl status app`: To check the status of the service.
- `systemctl stop app`: To stop the service.
