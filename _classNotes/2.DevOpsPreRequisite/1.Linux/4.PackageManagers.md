# Packages Managers

## Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)

- **RPM** is a package manager that is used in Red Hat-based distributions.
- It is used to install, update, and remove packages.
- `rpm -i package.rpm`: To install a package.
- `rpm -e package`: To remove a package.
- `rpm -q package`: To check if a package is installed.
- `rpm -qa`: To list all the installed packages.

- The RPM doesn't resolve dependencies automatically. So we can use `yum` to install packages and resolve dependencies.

## Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM)

- **YUM** is a package manager that is uses RPM under the hood. But it resolves dependencies automatically.
- `yum install package`: To install a package and its dependencies.
- `yum repolist`: To list the repositories.
- The directory where the repository files are stored: `/etc/yum.repos.d/`
- `ls /etc/yum.repos.d/`: To list the repository files.
- `cat /etc/yum.repos.d/repo_file`: To display the repository file.
- `yum list package`: To list the package information.
- `yum remove package`: To remove a package.
- `yum --showduplicates list package`: To list all the versions of a package.
- `yum install package-1.0-1`: To install a specific version of a package.
