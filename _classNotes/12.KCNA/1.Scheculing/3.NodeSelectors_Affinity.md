# Node Selectors

- **Node selectors** are used to constrain the set of nodes that a pod is eligible to be scheduled on.
  - They are used to select nodes based on their labels.
- They are specified as fields in the pod spec.
  ```yaml
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image
    nodeSelector:
      disktype: ssd # Refer a label on the node
  ```
  This pod will only be scheduled on nodes with the label `disktype=ssd`.
- To label a node: `kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>`.
- Limitations:
  - It's not possible to specify multiple node selectors or make complex logical expressions.
