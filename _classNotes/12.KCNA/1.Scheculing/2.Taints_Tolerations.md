# Taint and Tolerations

- **Taint** is a property of a node that tells the Kubernetes scheduler to not schedule any pods that do not tolerate the taint.
  - It's used to repel pods from nodes.
  - It's a key-value pair with an effect (NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute).
    - `NoSchedule`: The pod will not be scheduled on the node.
    - `PreferNoSchedule`: The scheduler will try to avoid placing a pod on the node.
    - `NoExecute`: The pod will be evicted if it's already running on the node. New pods will not be scheduled on the node.
  - Ex: `kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule`: This command taints the node `node1` with the key-value pair `key=value` and the effect `NoSchedule`.
- **Toleration** is a property of a pod that allows the pod to be scheduled on a node with a matching taint.
  - It's used to attract pods to nodes.
  - It's a key-value pair with an effect (NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute).
  - Ex: `spec.tolerations - key: "key" operator: "Equal" value: "value" effect: "NoSchedule"`: This toleration allows the pod to be scheduled on a node with the taint `key=value:NoSchedule`.
