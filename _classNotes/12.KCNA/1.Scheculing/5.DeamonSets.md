# Deamon Sets

- Deamon Sets are used to run a copy of a Pod on all or a subset of the nodes in a cluster.
  - It's like a `ReplicaSet` but it runs only one Pod per node.
- Use cases: monitoring agents, log collectors, etc.
- Another use cases are:
  - Kube-proxy: that is responsible for the networking in a cluster.
  - Weave-net: that is a network solution for Kubernetes.

## Creating a Deamon Set

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DeamonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-agent
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monitoring-agent
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: monitoring-agent
          image: monitoring-agent-image
```

- It's very similar to a `ReplicaSet`.
- `kubectl apply -f deamonset.yaml`
- `kubectl get deamonset`
- `kubectl describe deamonset monitoring-agent`

## Scheduled Deamon Sets

- You can schedule a Deamon Set to run only on specific nodes.
  - Until K8s v1.12, you use nodeName field in the pod spec.
  - From K8s v1.12, you use NodeAffinity and default scheduler.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DeamonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-agent
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monitoring-agent
    spec:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
                - key: disktype
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - ssd
      containers:
        - name: monitoring-agent
          image: monitoring-agent-image
```
