# Kubelet

- Kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster.
- It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of pods and ensuring that they are running as expected.
- Actions:
  - Register node: Kubelet registers the node with the Kubernetes API server.
  - Pod management: Kubelet is responsible for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting pods on the node.
  - Health checks/monitoring: Kubelet performs health checks on the pods and reports their status to the API server.
  - Resource management: Kubelet monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) and enforces resource limits for the pods.

## Installation

- Important: Kubeadm does not install kubelet. You need to install it on each node manually.
- `wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.24.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubelet`: Download the kubelet binary.
- `tar -xvf kubelet`: Extract the binary from the tar file.
- `sudo mv kubelet /usr/local/bin/`: Move the binary to the local bin directory.
- `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubelet`: Make the binary executable.
- `/usr/local/bin/kubelet`: Run the binary to check if it is working correctly.
- `cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubelet.yaml`: Check the kubelet manifest file.
- `ps -aux | grep kubelet`: Check if the kubelet process is running.
