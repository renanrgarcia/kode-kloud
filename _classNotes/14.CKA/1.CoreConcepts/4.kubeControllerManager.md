# kube Controller Manager

- **Kube Controller Manager**: It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of various resources in the cluster, such as nodes, pods, and replication controllers. It ensures that the desired state of the cluster is maintained by monitoring the state of the cluster and making changes as needed.
- Controller > watch status and remediate situations

## Node Controller

- Monitors the health of nodes and manages node lifecycle events. It is responsible for marking nodes as unavailable when they are not responding and for managing the process of adding and removing nodes from the cluster.
  - Node monitor period: The time interval at which the controller checks the status of nodes in the cluster. Default is 5 seconds.
  - Node monitor grace period: The time period that the controller waits before marking a node as unreachable. Default is 40 seconds.
  - Pod eviction timeout: The time period that the controller waits before evicting pods from an unreachable node. Default is 5 minutes.

## Replication Controller

- Ensures that the desired number of pods are running at all times. It is responsible for creating and deleting pods as needed to maintain the desired state of the cluster.

## Install kube-controller-manager

- Manual:
  - Download the kube-controller-manager binary from the official website to your cluster. Extract the binary and move it to a directory in your PATH.
  - Start kube-controller-manager.service and see the parameters:
    - `--node-monitor-period=5s`: The time interval at which the controller checks the status of nodes in the cluster.
    - `--node-monitor-grace-period=40s`: The time period that the controller waits before marking a node as unreachable.
    - `--pod-eviction-timeout=5m0s`: The time period that the controller waits before evicting pods from an unreachable node.
    - `--controllers stringSlice`: A comma-separated list of controllers to run. Default is `*,bootstrapsigner,tokencleaner`.
