# Kube Proxy

- Kube Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster. It is responsible for maintaining network rules on nodes and enabling network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of the cluster.
- It's responsible for routing traffic to the appropriate backend Pods based on the service type and the selected Pods.
  - It listens for new services and endpoints and updates the network rules accordingly.
- Kube Proxy can operate in different modes, including:
  - **iptables mode**: Uses iptables rules to manage network traffic.
  - **ipvs mode**: Uses IP Virtual Server (IPVS) for load balancing.
  - **userspace mode**: Uses a userspace proxy to handle traffic (deprecated).
