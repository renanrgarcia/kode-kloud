# Kube Scheduler

- It only schedules pods to nodes. It does not run the pods. Who runs the pods is the kubelet.
- Criteria for scheduling:
  - Resource requirements (CPU, memory, etc.)
  - Affinity and anti-affinity rules
  - Taints and tolerations
  - Node selectors and node affinity
  - Custom scheduling policies (using custom schedulers)
- `kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system`: Check the kube-scheduler pod.

## Installation
