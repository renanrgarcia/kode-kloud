# Kube ApiServer

- **Kube API Server**: The API server is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and is responsible for handling all REST requests to the cluster. It serves as the main entry point for all administrative tasks and is responsible for managing the state of the cluster.
- It authenticates and authorizes requests, validates and processes them, and updates the cluster state in etcd.
  - For example, when you run `kubectl get nodes`, the command sends a request to the API server, which retrieves the list of nodes from etcd and returns it to the client.
  - For creating a pod, the API server creates a new object, updates etcd, and the scheduler, that are continuously watching kube-apiserver, will pick it up and schedule it to a node. Then, kube-apiserver will call the kubelet on that node to create the pod. Then, kube-apiserver will update etcd with the new pod status.
- So, the API server is the central component of the Kubernetes control plane and is responsible for managing the state of the cluster.
- Main actions: 1. Authenticate user, 2. Validate request, 3. Retrieve data, 4. Update etcd, 5. Notify other components: scheduler, controller manager, kubelet.

## Installing

- Manual:
  - Download the kube-apiserver binary from the official website to your cluster. Extract the binary and move it to a directory in your PATH.
  - Start kube-apiserver.service and see the parameters:
    - `--etcd-cafile=/var/lib/kubernetes/ca.pem`: The CA certificate used to verify the etcd server's certificate.
    - `--etcd-certfile=/var/lib/kubernetes/kubernetes.pem`: The client certificate used to authenticate the kube-apiserver to etcd.
    - `--etcd-keyfile=/var/lib/kubernetes/kubernetes-key.pem`: The client key used to authenticate the kube-apiserver to etcd.
    - `--kubelet-certificate-authority=/var/lib/kubernetes/ca.pem`: The CA certificate used to verify the kubelet's certificate.
    - `--kubelet-client-certificate=/var/lib/kubernetes/kubernetes.pem`: The client certificate used to authenticate the kube-apiserver to the kubelet.
    - `--kubelet-client-key=/var/lib/kubernetes/kubernetes-key.pem`: The client key used to authenticate the kube-apiserver to the kubelet.
    - `--kubelet-https=true`: Use HTTPS to communicate with the kubelet.
    - `--etcd-servers=https://<etcd-ip>:2379`: The URL of the etcd server.

## View api-server - kubeadm

- `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`: List all pods in the kube-system namespace. Search for `kube-apiserver-master`.
- `cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`: View the kube-apiserver manifest file. It contains the configuration for the kube-apiserver pod.
- `cat /etc/systemd/system/kube-apiserver.service`: View the kube-apiserver systemd service file. It contains the configuration for the kube-apiserver service.
- `ps -aux | grep kube-apiserver`: View the kube-apiserver process. It shows the command used to start the kube-apiserver.
