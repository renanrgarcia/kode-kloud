# Intro

- **Scheduling** on K8s is the process of assigning pods to nodes.
  - It's done by setting the `nodeName` field in the pod spec.
- Another way to do so is to create a Binding object that associates a pod with a node.
  - This is done by the K8s scheduler.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Binding
  metadata:
    name: my-binding
  target:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Node
    name: my-node # The nodeName field
  ```
- The scheduler doesn't schedule pods on master nodes by default.
  - To see this command: `kubectl describe node kube-master | grep -i taint`.

## Labels and Selectors

- **Labels** are key-value pairs attached to objects.

  - They are used to organize and select subsets of objects.

- **Selectors** are used to filter objects based on labels.
  - They are used by controllers and services to select objects and the scheduler to select nodes for pods.
- `kubectl get pods --selector app=nginx` > This command will only show pods with the label `app=nginx`.

## Annotations

- **Annotations** are key-value pairs attached to objects.
  - They are used to store non-identifying information about the object.
  - They are not used to identify and select objects.
  - Ex: version number, checksum, build date, etc.
