# Shebang

- Shebang is a character sequence consisting of the characters hash and exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script.
- Some shells are different from others, so the shebang line tells the system which shell to use to execute the script.
  - Bourne shell: `#!/bin/sh`
  - Debian Almquist shell: `#!/bin/dash`
  - Bash: `#!/bin/bash`
