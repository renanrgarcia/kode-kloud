# Exit codes

- Every command returns an exit code when it finishes. The exit code is a number between 0 and 255. A zero exit code means the command was successful. A non-zero exit code indicates failure.
- The exit code is stored in the special variable `$?`.
  - You can print the exit code of the last command by running `echo $?`.
- To add an exit code to a script, use the `exit` command followed by the desired exit code.
  - For example, `exit 1` will exit the script with an exit code of 1.
- Although you can use any number between 0 and 255 as an exit code, it is common to use the following values:
  - `0`: Success
  - `1`: General error
  - `2`: Misuse of shell builtins
  - `126`: Command invoked cannot execute
  - `127`: Command not found
  - `128`: Invalid argument to exit
  - `128+n`: Fatal error signal `n`
  - `130`: Script terminated by `Ctrl+C`
  - `255`: Exit status out of range
- Always use appropriate exit codes in your scripts to indicate success or failure.
