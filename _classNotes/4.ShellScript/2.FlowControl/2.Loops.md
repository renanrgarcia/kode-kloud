# Loops

- **For Loop**: Used to iterate a set of commands over a series of items.

  - Ex:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    for i in $(cat file.txt)
    do
      echo $i
    done

    for number in {1..5}
    do
      echo "Number: $number"
    done

    for (( i=0; i<5; i++ ))
    do
      echo "Number: $i"
    done

    for file in $(ls)
    do
      echo Line count of $file is $(cat $file | wc -l)
    done

    for package in $(cat installed_packages.txt)
    do
      if [ $(dpkg-query -W -f='${Status}' $package 2>/dev/null | grep -c "ok installed") -eq 0 ]
      then
        echo $package is not installed
      else
        echo $package is installed
      fi
    done

    for server in $(cat servers.txt)
    do
      ssh $server "uptime"
    done
    ```

- **While Loop**: Used to execute a set of commands as long as the condition is true.

  - Ex:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    i=1
    while [ $i -le 5 ]
    do
      echo "Number: $i"
      i=$((i + 1))
    done

    while true
    do
      echo "1. Shutdown"
      echo "2. Restart"
      echo "3. Exit"
      read -p "Enter your choice: " choice

      if [ $choice -eq 1 ]
      then
        shutdown now
      elif [ $choice -eq 2 ]
      then
        shutdown -r now
      elif [ $choice -eq 3 ]
      then
        break
      else
        continue
      fi
    done
    ```

- **Case Statement**: Used to execute a set of commands based on the value of a variable.

  - Ex:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "1. Shutdown"
    echo "2. Restart"
    echo "3. Exit"
    read -p "Enter your choice: " choice

    case $choice in
      1) echo "One"
         ;;
      2) echo "Two"
         ;;
      3) break
         ;;
      *) continue
         ;;
    esac
    ```
