# Conditional Logic

- **if**: The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
  - Syntax:
    ```bash
    if [ condition ]
    then
      # code
    fi
    ```
  - Ex:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    if [ 1 -eq 1 ]
    then
      echo "1 is equal to 1"
    fi
    ```
- **if-else**: The `if-else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
  - Syntax:
    ```bash
    if [ condition ]
    then
      # code
    else
      # code
    fi
    ```
  - Ex:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    if [ 1 -eq 2 ]
    then
      echo "1 is equal to 2"
    else
      echo "1 is not equal to 2"
    fi
    ```
- **elif**: The `elif` statement is used to execute a block of code if the previous condition is false and the current condition is true.
  - Syntax:
    ```bash
    if [ condition1 ]
    then
      # code
    elif [ condition2 ]
    then
      # code
    else
      # code
    fi
    ```
  - Ex:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    if [ 1 -eq 2 ]
    then
      echo "1 is equal to 2"
    elif [ 1 -eq 1 ]
    then
      echo "1 is equal to 1"
    else
      echo "1 is not equal to 1 or 2"
    fi
    ```
- **Comparison Operators**:

  - `=`: Exactly equal to
  - `!=`: Not equal to
  - `-eq`: Equal to
  - `-ne`: Not equal to
  - `-gt`: Greater than
  - `-lt`: Less than
  - `-ge`: Greater than or equal to
  - `-le`: Less than or equal to

- `[[]]`: The `[[` and `]]` are used to test the condition.
  - [["abcd" == *bc*]] > if the string contains "bc".
  - [["abc" = ab[cd]]] > if 3rd character is "c" or "d".
  - [["abc" > "def"]] > if "abc" is greater than "def".

# Logical Operators

- **AND**: `&&` is used to execute a block of code if both conditions are true.
  - Ex:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    if [ 1 -eq 1 ] && [ 2 -eq 2 ]
    then
      echo "Both conditions are true"
    fi
    ```
- **OR**: `||` is used to execute a block of code if at least one condition is true.
  - Ex:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    if [ 1 -eq 1 ] || [ 2 -eq 3 ]
    then
      echo "At least one condition is true"
    fi
    ```

# File Test Operators

- `[ -e filename ]`: Check if the file exists.
- `[ -f filename ]`: Check if the file is a regular file.
- `[ -d filename ]`: Check if the file is a directory.
- `[ -s filename ]`: Check if the file exists and has a size greater than zero.
- `[ -x filename ]`: Check if the file is executable.
- `[ -w filename ]`: Check if the file is writable.
