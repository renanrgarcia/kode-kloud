# Kustomization vs Helm

- Helm
  - Makes use of Go templates to allow assigning variables to properties.
    - {{ .Values.replicas }} < means that the value of replicas is taken from the values.yaml file.
- Comparing the structure of Helm and Kustomize:

  - Helm
    - envoiroments/: has the values.yaml file to store the values for each environment.
    - templates/: has the templates for the resources.
  - Kustomize
    - base/: has the base resources.
    - overlays/: has the overlays for each environment.

- Helm is more than to customize the resources, it is a package manager for Kubernetes.
- Helm provides extra features like: conditionals, loops, functions and hooks.
- Helm templates are not valid Yaml files. It becomes more difficult to read and maintain.
