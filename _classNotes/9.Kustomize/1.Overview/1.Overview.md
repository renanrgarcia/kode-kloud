# Kustomize Overview

- Kustomize is a tool to customize Kubernetes objects through a kustomization file.
- It solves the problem of managing multiple versions of Kubernetes objects.
  - For example, different environments like dev, test, and prod.
- Built into `kubectl` since version 1.14.
  - But it is recommended to use the standalone version, for more up-to-date features.
- Does not require learning new structures or syntax, like Helm.

## Example

- Suppose you have a deployment file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
```

## Base and Overlay

- **Base**: The original resource file. Contains the common configuration.
- **Overlay**: The file that contains the changes to the base file.
- **Kustomization file**: The file that specifies the base and overlay files.

- In our example, we can have the overlays for dev, test, and prod environments.

```yaml
overlays/dev
spec:
  replicas: 2 # override the replicas value

overlays/test
spec:
  replicas: 3

overlays/prod
spec:
  replicas: 4
```

## Folder Structure

```bash
k8s
├── base # share ou default configuration
│   └── kustomization.yaml
│   └── nginx-deployment.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
│   └── redis-deployment.yaml
