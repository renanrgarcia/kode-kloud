# Garbage Collection

- Garbage collection is a feature of Kustomize that allows you to remove resources that are no longer needed. In this case, not used ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- `kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/prod --prune -l label_name=config_label`
  - `--prune`: flag to remove the resources that are not in the kustomization.yaml file.
  - `-l label_name=config_label`: flag to filter the resources to be removed by the label.
  - It'll only maintain the resources used.
