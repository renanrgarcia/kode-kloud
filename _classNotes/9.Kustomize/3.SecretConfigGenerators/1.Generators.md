# Generators

- Generators are used to generate the configuration files for the resources.
- What they solve?
  - For example, when we have a configMap and its value change, if we have a Deployment that uses this configMap, it will not be updated automatically.
  - To work, we need to `kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>`.
- So, we want a way to update the Deployment automatically when the configMap or secret changes.

## ConfigMap/Secret Generators

- The Generator will create a new resource with the new value of the configMap or secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: db-cred # The generator adds a hash to the name: db-cred-<hash, example: db-cred-5d45th
data:
  password: "password1"
```

- api-deploy.yaml:

```yaml
env:
  - name: DB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-cred # Kustomize will add the hash to the name: db-cred-5d45th
        key: password
```

- If the value of the password changes, the Generator will create a new ConfigMap with the new value and the Deployment will be updated automatically. It occurs using the hash in the name of the ConfigMap.
- To configure it on the kustomization.yaml:

```yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: db-cred
    literals:
      - password=password1
```

- It will create a ConfigMap with the name db-cred-5d45th.
- Another example is nginx.config.

```yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: nginx-config
    files:
      - nginx.conf
```

- It will create a ConfigMap with the content of the file nginx.conf.

```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    }
}
```

- And the ConfigMap generated:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  nginx.conf: "server
{\r\n    listen 80;
\r\n    server_name example.com;
\r\n    location / {
\r\n    }
\r\n}
\r\n"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-config-lk5d4w
```

- Using for secrets:

```yaml
secretGenerator:
  - name: db-cred
    literals:
      - password=password1
```

- It will create a Secret with the name db-cred-56kj32.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQx
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-cred-56kj32
type: Opaque
```
