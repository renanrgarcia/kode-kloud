# Managing Directories

- Kustomize allows you to manage directories in a more structured way.
- Example: Suppose you have a directory structure like this:

```bash
k8s
├── kustomization.yaml
├── api
│   ├── api-depl.yaml
│   ├── api-svc.yaml
├── db
│   ├── db-depl.yaml
│   ├── db-svc.yaml
```

- `kubectl apply -f k8s/api` to apply the resources in the `api` directory. And the same for the `db` directory.
  - But as the number of directories increases, it becomes difficult to manage them.
- We can use the `kustomization.yaml` file to manage the directories in a more structured way.
- The `kustomization.yaml` file will specify the resources in the directories.

```yaml
# k8s/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

# k8s resources to be managed by kustomize
resources:
  - api/api-depl.yaml
  - api/api-svc.yaml
  - db/db-depl.yaml
  - db/db-svc.yaml
```

- `kustomize build k8s | kubectl apply -f -` to apply the resources to the cluster.
  - Or `kubectl apply -k k8s` to apply the resources using kustomize.
- But still its a problem as the number of directories increases.
- We can use the `kustomization.yaml` file to manage the directories in a more structured way:
  - Add the `kustomization.yaml` file in each directory.
  - And in the main `kustomization.yaml` file, specify the directories.

```yaml
# k8s/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

# k8s resources to be managed by kustomize
resources:
  - api/
  - db/
```

- Now, `kustomize build k8s | kubectl apply -f -` to apply the resources on all folders to the cluster.
  - Or `kubectl apply -k k8s` to apply the resources using kustomize.
