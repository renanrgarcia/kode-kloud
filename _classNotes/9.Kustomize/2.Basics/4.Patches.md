# Patches

- Unlike common transformers, patches are used to apply specific changes, targeting specific fields of a resource.
- We need 3 parameters to apply a patch:
  - **operation type**: add, replace or remove
  - **target**: the field to be patched:
    - Kind
    - Version/Group
    - Name
    - Namespace
    - LabelSelector
    - AnnotationSelector
  - **Value**: the new value for the field. Only required for add and replace operations.
- Example:
  - Suppose we have a deployment file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
```

- We can use the following patch:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |- # The patch to be applied
    - op: replace
      path: /metadata/name
      value: web-deployment
```

- Or replicas:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/replicas
      value: 2
```

## PatchStrategicMerge vs PatchJson6902

- There are two types of patches in kustomize, we can use either of them:
  - **PatchJson6902**: Used to apply patches in the JSON format. RFC 6902.
  - **PatchStrategicMerge**: Used to apply patches to the resources in the YAML format.
- Example:

```yaml
patches: # According to PatchJson6902
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /metadata/name
      value: web-deployment
```

```yaml
patches: # According to PatchStrategicMerge
  - patch: |-
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: api-deployment # The name of the resource to be patched
    spec:
      replicas: 2 # The new value for the replicas field
```

## Inline vs Separate Patches

- We can specify the patches in the `kustomization.yaml` file in two ways:
  - **Inline**: The patches are specified in the `kustomization.yaml` file itself.
  - **Separate**: The patches are specified in separate files.
- It works the same way both PatchJson6902 and PatchStrategicMerge.

### Inline Patches

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /metadata/name
      value: web-deployment
```

### Separate Patches

- Create a file `patch.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml # deploy-patch.yaml
- op: replace
  path: /metadata/name
  value: web-deployment
```

```yaml # on the kustomization.yaml file
patches:
  - deployment-patch.yaml
```

## Patches Dictionary

- We can use a dictionary to specify multiple patches for different resources.
- Example:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    - op: add
    - path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/env
    - value:
        - name: MY_ENV_VAR
          value: my-value
```

```yaml
patches:
  - label-patch.yaml
```

- Create a file `label-patch.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
appVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        org: myorg
```

- To remove:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    - op: remove
      path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/env
```

## Replace list

- We can replace the entire list with a new list.
- Example:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0 # "0" is the index of the List
      value:
        name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

- To Add:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
    patch: |-
    - op: add
      path: /spec/template/spec/containers/- # "-" is used to append to the list
      value:
        name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

To remove:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    - op: remove
      path: /spec/template/spec/containers/1 # "1" is the index of the List
```

To delete on StrategicMergePatch:

```yaml
patches:
  - target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-deployment
  - patch: |-
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: api-deployment
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - $patch: delete # Delete directive: specifies which element to delete
              name: nginx
```
