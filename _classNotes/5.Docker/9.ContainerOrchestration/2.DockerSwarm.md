# Docker Swarm

- Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool that manages a cluster of Docker hosts.
- It is a native clustering tool provided by Docker.
- We need to have some Docker hosts to create a Docker Swarm cluster.
  - One Docker host can be converted into a `Swarm manager`.
    - `docker swarm init` command is used to convert a Docker host into a `Swarm manager`.
  - Other Docker hosts can be converted into `Swarm workers` or `Swarm nodes`.
    - `docker swarm join --token <token>` command is used to convert a Docker host into a `Swarm worker`.
- Docker Service is the primary unit of work in Docker Swarm.
  - A service is a definition of the desired state of a container.
  - It is used to scale the containers across the Docker Swarm cluster.
  - `docker service create --replicas 3 <image>` command is used to create a service with 3 replicas, must be run on the `Swarm manager`.
