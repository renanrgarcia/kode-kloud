# K8s

- `kbectl` is the command line tool for k8s.
- `kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/myapp` is used to scale the deployment to 3 replicas.
- `kubectl run --replicas=3 myapp` is used to create a deployment with 3 replicas.
- `kubectl rolling-update myapp --image=myapp:v2` is used to update the image of the deployment.
- `kubectl rolling-update myapp --image=myapp:v2 --rollback` is used to rollback the deployment to the previous version.

- K8s also supports other container runtimes like `containerd`, `cri-o`, etc. But `docker` is the most popular container runtime.

## Node (Minion)

- A node is a worker machine in k8s.

## Cluster

- A set of nodes is called a cluster.

## Master

- A master is a machine that controls the cluster.

## Components

- K8s has the following components:
  - API Server: Exposes the k8s API. It is the front end of the k8s control plane.
  - etcd: Consistent and highly-available key value store used as k8s' backing store for all cluster data.
  - Scheduler: Watches for newly created pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.
  - Controller Manager: Runs controller processes. Controllers are the brain behind the orchestration.
  - Kubelet: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a pod.
  - Container Runtime: Software that is responsible for running containers. Mainly `docker`.
