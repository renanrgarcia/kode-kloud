# Intro

- Why Docker?
  - Manage dependencies, simplify deployment, and increase productivity.

## Containers vs VMs

- Containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel.
- VMs are heavier and run a full OS.
- Containers are faster to start and stop.
- Containers don't have the overhead of a full OS.

## Containers + VMs

- On large deployments, you can run containers inside VMs.
- This is called a "hybrid" approach. It gives you the best of both worlds.

## Public Docker Registry

- Docker Hub is the public registry for Docker images. You can find images for almost anything.
- You can also host your own private registry.
- `docker run <image>` will pull the image from Docker Hub if it's not already on your machine.

## Container vs Image

- An image is a snapshot of a container.
- A container is a running instance of an image.

## Docker in DevOps

- Dockerfile is used to create images based on the application by the Dev team.
- That image is then passed to the Ops team to deploy.

## Docker Editions

- Docker Community Edition (CE) is free.
- Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) is paid. It has more features and support.

## Installation

- [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Test: `docker run hello-world`
