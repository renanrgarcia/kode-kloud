# Docker Registry

- Docker Registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. It's a server-side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images.
- Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default.
- Image: docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
  - `docker.io`: The registry where the image is stored. Others: `quay.io`, `ghcr.io`, `registry.gitlab.com`.
  - `library`: The namespace where the image is stored.
  - `hello-world`: The name of the image.
  - `latest`: The tag of the image.
- Private registry: We can create our own private registry to store and distribute images.
  - `docker login registry.example.com`: Logs in to the private registry.
  - `docker run private-registry.example.com/my-image:latest`: Pulls the image from the private registry.

## Deploy a private registry

- `docker image tag hello-world:latest registry.example.com/my-image:latest`: Tags the image.
- `docker push registry.example.com/my-image:latest`: Pushes the image to the private registry.
- `docker pull registry.example.com/my-image:latest`: Pulls the image from the private registry.
