# Hardware

- USB > Kernel space (Device drive) > User space (udev) > /dev/sbd1
- `dmesg` to view the kernel messages, also have logs from the hardware devices
  - Use `dmesg | grep -i usb` to filter the USB messages
- `udevadm` is the daemon that manages the devices
  - `udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/sdb1` to get the path of the device
- `udevadm monitor` to monitor the devices
- `lspci` to list the PCI devices (PCI = Peripheral Component Interconnect)
- `lsblk` to list the block devices, like hard drives on partitions
- `lscpu` to list the CPU information, like the number of cores, threads, etc.
  - Nowadays, we use 64-bit architecture. It can handle 2^64 bits of data and max memory of 16 exabytes.
  - Sockets: number of physical CPUs
  - Cores per socket: number of cores in each CPU
  - Threads per core: number of threads in each core. A thread is a virtual core.
  - Number of CPUs: Socket _ Cores per socket _ Threads per core
- `lsmem --summary` to list the memory information
  - `lsmem` to list the memory information in detail
- `free -m` to list the memory information
- `lshw` to list the hardware information
