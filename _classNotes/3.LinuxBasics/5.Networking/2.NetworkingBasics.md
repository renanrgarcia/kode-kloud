# Networking basics

## Switching

- Switches are used to connect multiple devices on the same network.
- We need adapters on the devices to connect to the switch.
- `ip link` command is used to see the network interfaces.
- `ip addr` command is used to see the IP addresses of the network interfaces.
- `ip addr add ip_address dev interface_name` is used to assign an IP address to an interface.
- `ip link set interface_name up` is used to bring the interface up.
- `ip link set interface_name down` is used to bring the interface down.

## Routing

- Routers are used to connect multiple networks. Connects two or more switches.
- `route` or `ip route` command is used to see the routing table.
- `ip route add network_address via interface_name` is used to add a route to the routing table.

## Gateway

- Gateway is the device that connects the local network to the internet.
- `ip route add default via gateway_ip` is used to add a default gateway.
  - It means that if the IP address is not in the routing table, it will be sent to the default gateway.
- `ip route add ip_address via gateway_ip` is used to add a route to a specific IP address.
  - Now we can see the route on `route` command.
- `0.0.0.0` is used to represent the default route. It means that if the IP address is not in the routing table, it will be sent to the default gateway.
