# Linux Security

- **Access Controls** are used to protect data from unauthorized access.
- **PAM** (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a framework for authentication. Used to authenticate users.
- **Network Security** is used to protect data from unauthorized access over the network.
- **SSH Hardening** is used to protect the SSH server from unauthorized access.
- **SELinux** (Security Enhanced Linux) is used to protect the system from unauthorized access.

## Linux Accounts and Groups

- **Root Account**: The root account is the superuser account. It has all the privileges.
- **Regular User Account**: Regular user accounts are created for normal users. They have limited privileges.
- **User ID (UID)**: A unique number assigned to each user.
- The information about users is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file.

- **Group**: A group is a collection of users. It is used to manage permissions.
  - Ex: `developers: user1, user2, user3`
- **Group ID (GID)**: A unique number assigned to each group.
- The information about groups is stored in the `/etc/group` file.

- Each User has:
  - username
  - UID
  - GID (if not specified, it will be the same as the UID. The primary group.)
  - Home directory (/home/username)
  - Default Shell (/bin/sh)
- `id username`: To get the UID, GID, and groups of a user.
- `grep -i username /etc/passwd`: To get the home directory and default shell of a user.

### Account types

- **User Accounts**: Used by normal users. They have a login shell.
  - Bob, Alice, etc.
- **Superuser Accounts**: Used by the system administrator. They have all the privileges. UID = 0.
  - root
- **System Accounts**: Used by the system. They have no login shell. UID < 100 or 500-1000.
  - ssh, mail, etc.
- **Service Accounts**: Used by services. They have no login shell. UID > 1000.

  - apache, mysql, etc.

- `id`: To get the UID, GID, and groups of the current user.
- `who`: Users who are currently logged in.
- `whoami`: The current username.
- `last`: Last logged in users. And date and time of the last system reboot.

### User Management

- `su -`: Switch to the root user.
- `su -c "command"`: Run a command as the root user. But best practice is to use `sudo`.
  - `sudo command`: Run a command as the root user.
- `grep -i ^root /etc/passwd`: To get the information about the root user.
  - If the shell is `/sbin/nologin`, the user cannot login as root.
- `cat /etc/sudoers`: Policies for superuser access.
  - `sudo visudo`: Edit the sudoers file.
  - Configuration format:
    - Field 1 - User or group - Ex: bob, %sudo (group)
    - Field 2 - Hosts - Ex: localhost, ALL(default)
    - Field 3 - User - Ex: ALL (default)
    - Field 4 - Command - Ex: /bin/ls, ALL (unrestricted)
