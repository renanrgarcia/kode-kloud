# Kernel

- Kernel is the core of the operating system. It is responsible for managing the system resources and providing the lowest-level abstraction layer for resources (especially memory, processors, and I/O devices).
- It is the first program that is loaded into memory when the system boots up.
- It's monolithic, meaning that it runs in a single address space.
- It's modular, meaning that it can be extended by loading modules at runtime.

## Responsibilities

- **Memory Management**: Allocating memory, freeing memory, and managing virtual memory.
- **Process Management**: Scheduling processes, creating and destroying processes, and managing process communication.
- **Device Management**: Managing I/O devices, including storage devices, network interfaces, and other hardware.
- **System Calls and Security**: Providing an interface for system calls and managing security.

## Commands

- `uname`: To view the kernel name.
- `uname -r`: To view the kernel release.
  - <kernel_version>.<major_release>.<minor_release>-<patch_level>-<distro_specific>
- See more on kernel.org

## Spaces

- **User Space**: The space where user applications run.
  - Applications/Programs
  - Actions: open/read/write files, list processes, etc. Ex: `open()` to `cat /etc/os-release`
- **Kernel Space**: The space where the kernel runs.
  - Kernel
  - Device drivers
- System calls are used to communicate between user space and kernel space.
