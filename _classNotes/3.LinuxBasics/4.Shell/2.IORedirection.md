# IO Redirection

- **Standard Input (stdin)**: The input to a command is referred to as standard input. By default, the standard input is the keyboard.
- **Standard Output (stdout)**: The output of a command is referred to as standard output. By default, the standard output is the terminal.
- **Standard Error (stderr)**: The error output of a command is referred to as standard error. By default, the standard error is the terminal.
- Example with `cat`:
  - `cat <file>`: Read the content of a file
  - `cat <file> > <output>`: Write the content of a file to another file
  - `cat <file> 2> <error>`: Write the error output of a file to another file
  - `cat <file> > <output> 2> <error>`: Write the content and error output of a file to different files
  - `cat <file> > <output> 2>&1`: Write the content and error output of a file to the same file
- **File Descriptor (fd)**: A file descriptor is a unique number that the operating system assigns to an open file. The three standard file descriptors are:
  - `0`: Standard input
  - `1`: Standard output
  - `2`: Standard error

## Redirecting Output

- `>`: Redirect standard output to a file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.
- `>>`: Redirect standard output to a file. If the file exists, it will be appended.

## Redirecting Error

- `2>`: Redirect standard error to a file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.
- `2>>`: Redirect standard error to a file. If the file exists, it will be appended.
- `2> /dev/null`: Discard the error output.

## Command line pipes

- `|`: Pipe the standard output of a command to the standard input of another command.
- `command1 | command2`: Pipe the output of `command1` to the input of `command2`.
- `tee`: Write to a file and to the standard output.
  - `command | tee <file>`: Write the output of a command to a file and to the standard output.
  - `command 2>&1 | tee <file>`: Write the output and error output of a command to a file and to the standard output.
