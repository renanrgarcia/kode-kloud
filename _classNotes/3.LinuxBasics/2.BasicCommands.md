# Basic Commands

- `pwd` to print the working directory
- `ls` to list the files in the directory
  - `ls -l` to list files in long format
  - `ls -a` to list all files including hidden files
  - `ls -la` to list all files in long format
  - `ls -ltr` to list files in long format sorted by time in reverse order
- `mkdir <directory_name> <directory2_name>` to create one or more directories
- `cd <directory_name>` to change the directory
- `cd` to change to the home directory
- `pushd <directory>`: This command saves the current directory by pushing it onto a stack and then changes to the specified `<directory>`. This is useful when you want to temporarily switch to another directory and then easily return to the original directory.
  - Example: If you are in `/home/user` and you run `pushd /var/log`, you will switch to `/var/log` and `/home/user` will be saved on the stack.
- `popd`: This command removes the top directory from the stack and changes to that directory. This allows you to return to the previous directory you were in before using `pushd`.
  - Example: Continuing from the previous example, if you run `popd`, you will switch back to `/home/user` which was saved on the stack.
