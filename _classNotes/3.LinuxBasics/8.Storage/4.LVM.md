# LVM (Logical Volume Manager)

- **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**: A system that manages disk storage by abstracting physical storage devices into logical volumes. It allows for dynamic resizing of volumes, snapshots, and more.
  - **Advantages**:
    - **Dynamic resizing**: Logical volumes can be resized without unmounting the file system.
    - **Snapshots**: Create point-in-time copies of logical volumes.
    - **Striping**: Improve performance by spreading data across multiple physical volumes.
    - **Mirroring**: Improve fault tolerance by creating copies of logical volumes.
- **Physical Volume (PV)**: A physical storage device or partition that is managed by LVM.
- **Physical Extent (PE)**: The smallest unit of storage in a volume group. It is typically 4MB in size.
- **Volume Group (VG)**: A collection of physical volumes that are combined to create a pool of storage.
- **Logical Volume (LV)**: A virtual partition created from a volume group. It can be resized dynamically.
- **Logical Extent (LE)**: The smallest unit of storage in a logical volume. It is mapped to physical extents in the volume group.

## Installing LVM

- `lvm2`: The package that provides LVM tools.
  - Install it using `sudo apt install lvm2`.
- `pvcreate /dev/sdX`: Initialize a physical volume on a disk partition.
- `vgcreate vg_name /dev/sdX`: Create a volume group using one or more physical volumes.
- `vgdisplay`: Display information about volume groups.
- `lvcreate -L size -n lv_name vg_name`: Create a logical volume of a specific size in a volume group.
- `lvdisplay`: Display information about logical volumes.
- `lvs`: Display information about logical volumes in a more concise format.
- `mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_name/lv_name`: Create an ext4 file system on a logical volume.
- `mount -t ext4 /dev/vg_name/lv_name /mnt/mount_point`: Mount a logical volume to a mount point.
- `vgs`: Display information about volume groups in a more concise format.
- `lvresize -L +size /dev/vg_name/lv_name`: Increase the size of a logical volume.
- `df -hP /mnt/mount_point`: Check the disk usage of a mounted logical volume.
- `resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name`: Resize the file system on a logical volume.
