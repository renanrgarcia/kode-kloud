# External Storage

- **External Storage** is a storage device that is not part of the computer itself, but is attached to it.
- Types of storage:
  - **DAS (Direct-Attached Storage)**: Storage that is directly attached to a computer.
    - Ex: External hard drives, USB drives.
  - **NAS (Network-Attached Storage)**: Storage that is connected to a network and can be accessed by multiple devices.
    - Ex: Network drives, cloud storage.
  - **SAN (Storage Area Network)**: A dedicated network for storage devices.
    - Ex: Fibre Channel, iSCSI.

## DAS

- Caracteristics:
  - `Block Storage`: Data is stored in fixed-size blocks.
  - `Fast and Reliable`: Direct connection to the computer.
  - `Affordable`: Cheaper than NAS and SAN.
  - `Dedicated to a Single Host`: Cannot be shared with other devices.
  - `Ideal for small businesses and home users`.

## NAS

- Caracteristics:
  - `NFS / CIFS`: Network protocols used to access the storage.
    - `NFS (Network File System)`: Used by Unix-like systems.
    - `CIFS (Common Internet File System)`: Used by Windows systems.
  - `Reasonably Fast and Reliable`: Slower than DAS, but still good performance.
  - `Accessible by Multiple Devices`: Can be shared with multiple devices.
  - `File based Storage`: Data is stored in files.
  - `Not suitable for OS installation`.
- Example of uses: backend or database storage.

## SAN

- Caracteristics:
  - `Fibre Channel / iSCSI`: Protocols used to access the storage.
    - `FC (Fibre Channel)`: High-speed network technology.
    - `iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface)`: Protocol that allows SCSI commands to be sent over IP networks.
  - `High Performance and Reliability`: Fast and reliable storage.
  - `Scalable`: Can be expanded to meet the needs of the organization.
  - `Shared Storage`: Can be shared with multiple devices.
  - `Expensive`: More expensive than DAS and NAS.
  - `Suitable for large enterprises`.
- Example of uses: virtualization, databases, and high-performance computing.
