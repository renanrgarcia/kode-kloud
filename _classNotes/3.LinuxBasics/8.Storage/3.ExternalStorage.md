# External Storage

- **External Storage** is a storage device that is not part of the computer itself, but is attached to it.
- Types of storage:
  - **DAS (Direct-Attached Storage)**: Storage that is directly attached to a computer.
    - Ex: External hard drives, USB drives.
  - **NAS (Network-Attached Storage)**: Storage that is connected to a network and can be accessed by multiple devices.
    - Ex: Network drives, cloud storage.
  - **SAN (Storage Area Network)**: A dedicated network for storage devices.
    - Ex: Fibre Channel, iSCSI.

## DAS

- Caracteristics:
  - `Block Storage`: Data is stored in fixed-size blocks.
  - `Fast and Reliable`: Direct connection to the computer.
  - `Affordable`: Cheaper than NAS and SAN.
  - `Dedicated to a Single Host`: Cannot be shared with other devices.
  - `Ideal for small businesses and home users`.

## NAS

- Caracteristics:
  - `NFS / CIFS`: Network protocols used to access the storage.
    - `NFS (Network File System)`: Used by Unix-like systems.
    - `CIFS (Common Internet File System)`: Used by Windows systems.
  - `Reasonably Fast and Reliable`: Slower than DAS, but still good performance.
  - `Accessible by Multiple Devices`: Can be shared with multiple devices.
  - `File based Storage`: Data is stored in files.
  - `Not suitable for OS installation`.
- Example of uses: backend or database storage.

## SAN

- Caracteristics:
  - `Fibre Channel / iSCSI`: Protocols used to access the storage.
    - `FC (Fibre Channel)`: High-speed network technology.
    - `iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface)`: Protocol that allows SCSI commands to be sent over IP networks.
  - `High Performance and Reliability`: Fast and reliable storage.
  - `Scalable`: Can be expanded to meet the needs of the organization.
  - `Shared Storage`: Can be shared with multiple devices.
  - `Expensive`: More expensive than DAS and NAS.
  - `Suitable for large enterprises`.
- Example of uses: virtualization, databases, and high-performance computing.

# NFS

- **NFS (Network File System)** is a distributed file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network as if the files were on the local computer.
  - It's not a block storage system, but a file-based storage system.
- **NFS Server**: The computer that shares its files.
  - Ideally, it has a firewall to protect the shared files.
- **NFS Client**: The computer that accesses the shared files.
- **NFS Mount**: The process of attaching the shared files to the client computer.
- **NFS Export**: The shared directory on the NFS server.
- **NFS Mount Point**: The directory on the client computer where the shared files are attached.
- `/etc/exports`: File that contains the directories to be shared by the NFS server.
  - Format: `<directory> <client>(<options>)`
    - `<directory>`: The directory to be shared.
    - `<client>`: The client computer that can access the shared directory.
    - `<options>`: Options for the shared directory.
  - Ex: `/software/repos IP1 IP2 IP3` < IP addresses of the client computers that can access the shared directory.
- **NFS Commands**:
  - `showmount -e <server>`: List the shared directories on an NFS server.
  - `mount -t nfs <server>:<export> <mount-point>`: Mount an NFS export to a directory.
  - `umount <mount-point>`: Unmount an NFS export.
  - `df -hP | grep <mount-point>`: Check the disk usage of the NFS export.
    - `-h`: Human-readable format.
    - `-P`: POSIX output format.
  - `exportfs -a`: Export all directories in `/etc/exports`.
  - `exportfs -o IP:<directory>`: Export a directory to a specific IP address.
