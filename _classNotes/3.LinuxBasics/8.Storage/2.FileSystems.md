# File Systems

- File systems are the methods and data structures that an operating system uses to keep track of files on a disk or partition; that is, the way the files are organized on the disk.
- Create a file system > Mount it to a partition > Use it to store data.
- Common file systems:

  - **Ext2**: Old Linux file system.
    - 2TB maximum file size.
    - 4TB maximum partition size.
    - Supports compression.
    - Supports Linux permissions.
    - Long crash recovery time.
  - **Ext3**: Ext2 with journaling.
    - 2TB maximum file size.
    - 4TB maximum partition size.
    - Backward compatible with Ext2.
    - Supports journaling.
  - **Ext4**: Default file system for most Linux distributions.
    - 16TB maximum file size.
    - 1EB maximum partition size.
    - Supports journaling.
    - Uses checksums to ensure data integrity.
    - Backward compatible with Ext3.
  - **XFS**: High-performance file system for enterprise environments.
  - **Btrfs**: Modern file system with features like snapshots and checksums.
  - **NTFS**: File system used by Windows.
  - **FAT32**: File system used by older Windows versions and USB drives.

  - **NFS**: Network File System. Used by Unix-like systems.
  - **CIFS**: Common Internet File System. Used by Windows systems.

## Working with File Systems

- **Mounting**: Attaching a file system to a directory in the file system hierarchy.
- **Unmounting**: Detaching a file system from a directory.
- **Formatting**: Creating a file system on a partition.
- **Checking**: Verifying the integrity of a file system.

- `mkfs`: Command to create a file system.
  - `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1`: Create an Ext4 file system on `/dev/sda1`.
- `mkdir /mnt/ext4`: Create a directory to mount the file system.
- `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ext4`: Mount the file system to the directory.
- `mount | grep /dev/sda1`: Check if the file system is mounted.
- `blkid /dev/sda1`: Get the UUID and type of the file system.
- `df -hP | grep /dev/sda1`: Check the disk usage of the file system.
  - `-h`: Human-readable format.
  - `-P`: POSIX output format.
- `/etc/fstab`: File that contains the file systems to be mounted at boot time.
  - Format: `<device> <mount-point> <file-system-type> <options> <dump> <pass>`
    - `<device>`: The device file. The file system itself or a logical volume.
    - `<mount-point>`: The directory to mount the file system.
    - `<file-system-type>`: The file system type. Ex: `ext4`.
    - `<options>`: Mount options. `RW` for read-write, `RO` for read-only.
    - `<dump>`: Backup utility. `0` to ignore, `1` to take a backup.
    - `<pass>`: File system check order. `0` to ignore, `1` to check first, `2` to check after the first one.
  - Ex: `/dev/sda1 /mnt/ext4 ext4 defaults 0 0`
