# Deployments

- Deployments are a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and Pods. They provide declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets.
- Its main purpose is to maintain a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct configuration and that the right number of them is running.
