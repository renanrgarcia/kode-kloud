# Pods with Yaml

## Yamls in Kubernetes

- All resources in K8s have this base structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1 # K8s API version
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
```

- `apiVersion`: The version of the Kubernetes API you're using.
  - `v1` is the most common version: Pod, Service
  - `apps/v1` is the version for ReplicaSet, Deployment
- `kind`: The type of resource you want to create.
  - Pod, Service, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service, etc.
- `metadata`: Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace.
  - `name`: The name of the object.
  - `labels`: Key-value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics to the core system. Exs:
    - `app: myapp`
    - `type: front-end`
- `spec`: The desired state of the object. This is a description of the characteristics you want the resource to have. It's different for each type of resource. For pods:
  - `containers`: A list of containers that should be run inside this pod.
    - `name`: The name of the container.
      `image`: The Docker image to use.

## Creating a Pod with Yaml

- Create a file called `myapp-pod.yaml`.
- `kubectl apply -f myapp-pod.yaml`
- `kubectl edit pod myapp-pod`: Edit the pod.
- Namespace: A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users.
