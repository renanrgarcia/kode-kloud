# Docker vs Containerd

- `Docker` is a container runtime and `Containerd` is a container daemon.
  - That means that `Docker` is a high-level tool that uses `Containerd` as a low-level runtime.
- `Containerd` is a daemon that manages the complete container lifecycle.
- CRI (Container Runtime Interface) is a standard that allows `Kubernetes` to use different container runtimes.
  - OCI (Open Container Initiative) is a standard for container runtimes. Has imagespec and runtimespec.
  - `Containerd` is one of the runtimes that implements the CRI. It was implemented to replace docker-shim (v.1.24)

## Containerd

- It's a separate project from Docker.
- It comes with ctr, a CLI to interact with the containerd daemon.
  - Not very user-friendly.
  - Only supports limited features.
- Alternative: nerdctl, a CLI that is compatible with Docker CLI.
  - It's a wrapper around containerd.
  - Supports docker compose.
  - Supports newest features from containerd:
    - Encrypted container images.
    - Lazy pulling.
    - P2P image distribution.
    - Image signing and verifyng.
    - Namespaces in Kubernetes.
  - Ex: `nerdctl run -d -p 8080:80 nginx`, `nerdctl ps`, `nerdctl exec -it container_id bash`
- Other important tool is crictl, a CLI to compatible container runtimes.
  - Installed separately. Used to inspect and debug containers, not ideal to create them.
  - Ex: `crictl ps`, `crictl exec -it container_id bash`, `crictl logs`, `crictl pods`

## Docker Deprecation

- After Containerd adoption, Docker could be deprecated.
  - But it's the most popular container runtime. So it's not going to happen soon.
