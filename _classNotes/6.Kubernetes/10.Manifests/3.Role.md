# Role

- A Role is a namespaced resource that defines a set of permissions within a specific namespace.
- It allows you to grant access to resources like pods, services, and secrets within that namespace.
- Roles are used to control access to resources at a more granular level than cluster-wide permissions.
- Syntax:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: my-role
  namespace: my-namespace
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""] # API group for resources like deployments, replicasets, etc.
    resources: ["pods"] # Core resources like pods, services, etc.
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"] # Actions allowed on the resources
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments"]
    verbs: ["create", "update", "delete"]
```
