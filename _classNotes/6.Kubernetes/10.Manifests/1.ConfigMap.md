# ConfigMap

- ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object that allows you to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. It is used to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, making it easier to manage and deploy applications in different environments.
- Syntax:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
```

- Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  database_url: "mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname"
  log_level: "info"
```
