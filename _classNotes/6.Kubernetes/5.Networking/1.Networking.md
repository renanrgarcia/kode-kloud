# Network

- When using MiniKube, we have a single node with a single IP address. Different from the host IP address.
- On other nodes, we have an IP address for each node.
  - We have different IP addresses for each pod.
- It's created a virtual network inside the node for the pods to communicate with each other.
  - Ex: `10.244.0.0` < IP address range for the pods.
  - Pods: `10.244.0.2`, `10.244.0.3`, `10.244.0.4`.
- All pods/containers can communicate with each other without NAT (Network Address Translation). The same occurs with the nodes in the cluster.
- When we have multiple nodes in the cluster, we need a network plugin to create a virtual network that spans all the nodes.
  - Ex: Flannel, Calico, Weave Net, Cisco ACI, NSX-T, etc.
  - They provide a virtual network that spans all the nodes in the cluster and the pods to communicate with each other.
