# Cloud K8s

- There are two ways of running Kubernetes on both private or public cloud:
  - **Self-hosted/Turnkey Solutions**:
    - You provision, configure and manage the VMs and the Kubernetes cluster yourself.
    - Examples: Kops, Kubeadm, Kubespray, KubeOne, etc.
  - **Managed/Hosted Solutions**:
    - The cloud provider provisions, configures and manages the VMs and the Kubernetes cluster for you.
    - Kubernetes-as-a-Service (KaaS).
    - Examples: GKE, EKS, AKS, etc.
