# Pods

- First assumptions: application is done and its image is built and pushed to a registry (Docker Hub, GCR, ECR, etc)
- Also, we have a K8s cluster running (Minikube, GKE, EKS, etc)
- **Pods** are the smallest deployable units in K8s. They encapsulate an application container (or multiple), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.
  - The ideal is to have one container per pod.
  - But in some cases, it's possible to have multiple containers in a pod. For example, Helper containers.
- If the requests are too high, we can scale the pods horizontally (more replicas) or vertically (more resources).
  - If needed, we can also scale the cluster itself (more nodes).
- `kubectl run <name> --image=<image>`: creates a pod with a single container.
  - `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`: creates a pod with a single container. Using deployment, it's possible to scale the pods.
- `kubectl get pods`: list all pods.
- `kubectl get pods -o wide`: list all pods with more information.
- `kubectl describe pod <name>`: describe a pod.
