# Imperative vs Declarative

- **Imperative**: You tell the system how to do something. Example on real world: You take a cab and tell him the exact route to take to reach your destination.
  - Example on IaC:
    1. Create a VM
    2. Install Nginx
    3. Edit config file to use port 8080 and path `/var/www/nginx`
    4. Load web pages to `/var/www/nginx` from git repository
    5. Start Nginx server
- **Declarative**: You tell the system what you want to achieve and the system will take care of it. Example on real world: You take a cab and tell him the destination, the cab driver will take care of the route.
  - Example on IaC:
    ```yaml
    VM Name: web-server
    Package: Nginx
    Port: 8080
    Path: /var/www/nginx
    Code: GIT Repo - X
    ```

## On K8s

- **Imperative**: You tell K8s how to do something. Example:
  ```bash
  kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
  kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
  ```
- **Declarative**: You tell K8s what you want to achieve. Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: nginx
  spec: ...
  ```
  `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` > The system will take care of the rest.

## Pros and Cons

- **Imperative**:
  - Pros:
    - Changes that doesn't need to persist
    - Do actions to save time
  - Cons:
    - Hard to maintain
    - Not scalable
- **Declarative**:
  - Pros:
    - Easy to maintain
    - Scalable
    - Can be version controlled
