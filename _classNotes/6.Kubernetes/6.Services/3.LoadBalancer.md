# Load Balancer

- Load Balancer is a service that exposes an application to the internet and distributes the traffic across multiple pods.
- We give one IP address to the Load Balancer and it will distribute the traffic to the pods.
- We can set a Load Balancer on a VM, but it's not recommended because it's too dificult to manage.
- The best way to set a Native Load Balancer is using a cloud provider.
- Definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30008
  selector:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
```
