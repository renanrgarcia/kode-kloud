# ClusterIP

- Used to communicate between different pods/nodes.
  - Example: if we have frontend and backend pods the frontend pod can communicate with the backend pod using the ClusterIP service.
  - This way, each layer of the application can be scaled independently. And the frontend pod doesn't need to know the IP address of the backend pod and vice-versa.
- Definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: back-end
spec:
  type: ClusterIP # Service type. This is the default service type.
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80 # Port that backend pods are listening to.
      port: 80 # Port that the service is listening to.
  selector:
    app: myapp # Label of the pod to be accessed.
    type: back-end # Label of the pod to be accessed.
```

- `kubectl apply -f service-definition.yaml`: Create the Service.
- `kubectl get services`: Get the Service.
- Access from other pods using the cluster IP or the service name.
