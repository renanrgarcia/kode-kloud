# Intro

- `Helm` is a package manager for `Kubernetes`. A tool that streamlines installing and managing `Kubernetes` applications.
  - Allows to treat the `Kubernetes` resources as apps. So we don't need to micromanage all resources.
- `helm install application`: Install an application with all the necessary kubernetes resources.
  - Ex: Deploy, Service, PV, PVC, Secret, ConfigMap, etc.
- We can have a file with the custom configurations for the application. `values.yaml`, for example.
- `helm --help`: Show all the available commands.
- `helm upgrade application`: Upgrade an application.
- `helm rollback application`: Rollback an application.
- `helm uninstall application`: Uninstall an application.
- `helm list`: List all the installed charts.

- `helm search repo <chart-name>`: Search for a chart in the `Helm` repository.
- `helm search hub <chart-name>`: Search for a chart in the `Helm` hub, Artifact Hub.

- `helm repo add <repo-name> <repo-url>`: Add a repository to `Helm`.
- `helm repo list`: List all the repositories added to `Helm`.
- `helm repo update`: Update the repositories.

- `helm install <chart-name> <repo-name>/<chart-name>`: Install a chart from a repository.

## Install

- Pre requisites:
  - `kubectl` installed.
  - `Kubernetes` cluster running.
- Each OS have a different way to install `Helm`. Check the [official documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
