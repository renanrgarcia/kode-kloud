## Helm2

- Tiller (server-side component) was required. It had cluster-wide access (God mode).
  - This was a security concern.

## Helm3

- Tiller is removed.
  - Role based access control and Custom resource definitions are now used on Kubernetes.
- 3-way merge patching strategy, meaning that Helm will only update the fields that have changed.
  - Compare the current state of the resource with the desired state.
    - Live state, current chart, and the last chart.
