# Helm Components

- `helm cli`: The command line interface.
- `charts`: Packages of pre-configured `Kubernetes` resources.
  - When applied, it creates a `release` (instance of the chart).
- Within each release, we can have multiple `revisions`. That are like snapshots of the application.
- There are online repositories with charts. Ex: AppsCode, Bitnami, TrueCharts, Community Operators. All of them are available in the `ArtifactHub.io` > `Helm Hub`.
  - Prefer the official charts.
- Metadata (stored as a secret in the `Kubernetes` cluster) is used to keep track of the releases and revisions.
  - `Chart.yaml`: Information about the chart.
  - `values.yaml`: Default values for the chart.
  - `templates/`: Directory with the `Kubernetes` resources.
- `Templating`: Allows us to use variables and loops in the `Kubernetes` resources.
  - Ex: `{{ .Values.replicaCount }}`. The value is defined in the `values.yaml` file.
- `helm install <release-name> <chart-name>`: Install a chart. Ex: `helm install my-release stable/mysql`.
  - `helm install my-release2 stable/mysql`: Install another instance of the chart.
  - That way, the revisions are different for each release.
  - It's interesting for example for distinct environments (dev, test, prod).
- `helm list`: List the releases.
