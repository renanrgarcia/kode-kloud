# Introduction

- **GitOps** is a way to do **Continuous Deployment**.
- GitOps: IaC + Config Code + Application Code > Git > CI/CD > Cluster
- The idea is to equalize the desired state (App Code Repos + Kubernetes Manifests Repos) with the actual state (K8s Cluster).
  - The way: GitOps tools like **ArgoCD** run in the cluster and watch the desired state in the Git Repos, then apply the changes to the cluster.
- So, when the developer pushes the code through Git, the CI/CD pipeline will build the code and push the artifacts to the Docker Registry, then the GitOps tool will apply the changes to the cluster, after the changes on the manifests in the Git Repos.

## GitOps Principles

- **Declarative**: The desired state is declared in Git Repos, using YAML files.
- **Versioned**: The desired state is versioned in Git Repos, so we can track the changes.
- **Automated**: The desired state is applied to the cluster automatically by the GitOps tool.
- **Auditable**: The desired state is auditable, so we can track who changed what and when. Reconcialiation is done by the GitOps tool.
  - Observe, Diff and Act
