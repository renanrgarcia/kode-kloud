# DevOps vs GitOps

- DevOps pipeline:
  1. Code
  2. Push to repo
  3. CI: test, build, build image, push to registry
  4. CD: kubectl apply to Cluster
- GitOps pipeline:
  1. Code
  2. Push to repo
  3. CI: test, build, build image, push to registry, Clone manifests config repo, update manifests, push to feature branch and raise PR
  4. CD: ArgoCD watches the manifests repo, pull the changes, apply the changes to the cluster
