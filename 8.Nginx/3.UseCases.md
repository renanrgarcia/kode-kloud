# Use cases
## Forward Proxy
- Nginx can be configured as a forward proxy server, allowing clients to access external resources through it.
- It can handle caching, access control, and content filtering for outgoing requests.
- This is useful for scenarios where clients need to access the internet securely or anonymously.
- Example: Nginx can be set up to allow users within a corporate network to access the internet while enforcing security policies and logging access.

## Reverse Proxy
- Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy server to forward client requests to backend servers.
- It can handle SSL termination, caching, and load balancing, improving performance and security.
- This allows Nginx to act as an intermediary between clients and backend services, providing a single point of entry for requests.
- It can also provide additional features like request routing, URL rewriting, and access control.
- Example: Nginx can receive requests from clients and forward them to a web application server like Node.js or Python, while also caching static content and managing SSL certificates.

## Load Balancing
- Nginx can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to balance the load.
- It supports various load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.
- This checks the web server's health and ensures that requests are routed to healthy servers.
- Example: Nginx can be configured to route requests to multiple application servers, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed with traffic, thus improving availability and performance.

## Static Content Serving
- Nginx excels at serving static content like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- It can efficiently deliver these files directly to clients without involving backend servers, reducing latency and resource usage.
- Example: Nginx can serve a website's static assets directly from the file system, allowing for quick loading times and reduced server load.

## Caching
- Nginx can cache responses from backend servers to improve performance and reduce load.
- It supports various caching mechanisms, including static file caching and proxy caching for dynamic content.
- Example: Nginx can cache frequently accessed pages or API responses, serving them directly to clients without needing to contact the backend server, thus speeding up response times.
