# Nginx Architecture
- Nginx is designed with Event-Driven Architecture, which allows it to handle multiple connections simultaneously without consuming a lot of resources.
  - It uses an asynchronous, non-blocking event loop to manage requests.
  - This architecture is different from traditional web servers that use a process or thread per connection, which can lead to high memory usage and performance issues under heavy load.

## Event handling
- Nginx receives an HTTP request from a client.
- The request is processed in an event loop, where it is queued and handled asynchronously.
- Each request is processed in a single thread, allowing Nginx to handle thousands of requests concurrently without the overhead of creating multiple threads or processes.
- The response is sent back to the client once the request is fully processed.

## Key Components
- **Master Process**: The main process that manages worker processes and handles configuration changes. It is responsible for starting, stopping, and reloading the configuration of Nginx.
- **Worker Processes**: These processes handle the actual request processing. Each worker can handle multiple connections simultaneously due to the event-driven architecture. It has its own event loop and can process requests independently.
- **Event Loop**: The core of Nginx's architecture, which manages the asynchronous processing of requests. It listens for events (like incoming connections) and dispatches them to worker processes for handling.
- **Modules**: Nginx supports a modular architecture, allowing for the addition of various functionalities through modules. These can be built-in or third-party modules that extend Nginx's capabilities, such as handling different protocols, authentication, caching, and more.
- **Configuration Files**: Nginx uses a simple and flexible configuration file format, typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. This file defines how Nginx should behave, including server blocks, location directives, and other settings.
- **Logging**: Nginx provides logging capabilities to track requests, errors, and other events. Logs are typically stored in `/var/log/nginx/` and can be configured for access logs and error logs.
- **Caching**: Nginx can cache responses to improve performance and reduce load on backend servers. It supports various caching mechanisms, including static file caching and proxy caching for dynamic content.
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx can distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers to balance the load and improve performance. It supports various load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx can act as a reverse proxy server, forwarding client requests to backend servers and returning the responses. This allows for better resource utilization and improved security by hiding backend server details from clients.
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Nginx supports SSL/TLS for secure communication over HTTPS. It can handle SSL termination, allowing it to decrypt incoming requests and encrypt outgoing responses, enhancing security for web applications.
